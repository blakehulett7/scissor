            <p>Starting with the basics of CSS and HTML, you'll progress through creating responsive designs for mobile,
                tablet,
                and desktop layouts. You'll learn to code complex layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox and tackle
                real-world
                exercises like styling buttons, audio players, hamburger menus, and lists. You'll explore concepts like
                rem and
                em units, custom fonts, responsive images, and the picture element. By the end of the course, you'll
